## Anatomy of Equations

This section shows you some basic equations types that you want to be familiar with.





Inline equations are referenced by a pair of dollar signs: `$`.

```
So this text would have an equation here $ E = mc^2$
```

Generates:

So this text would have an equation here $ E = mc^2$

Display equations are referenced by two pairs of dollar signs:

```
$$
E = mc^2
$$
```

$$
E = mc^2
$$

#### Viewing equations

Understanding whether or not you have created the right equation can be difficult. What you want to do is create

#### Matrices

## Example math commands

LaTeX is an amazing language, but understanding how to create the equations can be (more than) a bit confusing at times. This section demonstrates some example equations that you might be familiar with.

### Examples

#### Bayes Rule

#### Residual Sums of Squares

#### Linear Model
